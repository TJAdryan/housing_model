Of course. Here is a `README.md` file you can save in your `vite-project` folder. This will give you a perfect summary and quick-start guide whenever you come back to it.

# The Wealth Gap Amplifier: An Interactive Model

This project is an interactive web-based model designed to demonstrate how housing market dynamics can perpetuate a wealth crisis and worsen economic inequality. It visualizes the "Wealth Gap Amplifier" model, showing how initial wealth disparities are magnified over time through mechanisms like cash buying and the conversion of homes into rental properties.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

Follow these steps to get the local development environment up and running. This project uses **Bun** as its package manager and runtime.

### 1\. Install Dependencies

If you're setting up this project for the first time, you need to install the necessary packages. From the project's root directory (`vite-project`), run:

```bash
bun install
```

### 2\. Run the Local Development Server

To start the live-reloading development server, run the following command:

```bash
bun dev
```

The terminal will provide a local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`). Open this URL in your web browser to see the project live. The server will automatically update the page whenever you save a change to a project file.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The core logic and structure of the model are contained in three main files:

  * **`index.html`**: This file contains the HTML structure of the webpage. Use it to build the dashboard, visualization area, and explanatory text sections for the model.
  * **`main.js`**: This is the brain of the project. All the JavaScript logic for the simulationâ€”including the rules for each round, wealth calculations, and updating the visualsâ€”goes here.
  * **`style.css`**: This file controls the visual presentation. Use it to style the layout, colors, charts, and animations to make the model clear and compelling.
